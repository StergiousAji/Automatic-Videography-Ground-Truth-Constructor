[00:11.83]I'm all out of hope
[00:15.82]One more bad break
[00:18.90]Could bring a fall
[00:22.91]When I'm far from home
[00:26.64]Don't call me on the phone
[00:29.57]To tell me you're alone
[00:33.95]It's easy to deceive
[00:37.93]It's easy to tease
[00:40.63]But hard to get release
[00:45.28](Les yeux sans visage)
[00:49.29]Eyes without a face
[00:50.90](Les yeux sans visage)
[00:54.94]Eyes without a face
[00:56.66](Les yeux sans visage)
[01:00.67]Eyes without a face
[01:03.40]Got no human grace
[01:06.02]You're eyes without a face
[01:10.61]♪
[01:18.99]I spent so much time
[01:23.08]Believing all the lies
[01:25.66]To keep the dream alive
[01:30.23]Now it makes me sad
[01:34.14]It makes me mad at truth
[01:36.85]For loving what was you
[01:41.48](Les yeux sans visage)
[01:45.46]Eyes without a face
[01:47.50](Les yeux sans visage)
[01:51.19]Eyes without a face
[01:52.73](Les yeux sans visage)
[01:56.76]Eyes without a face
[01:59.41]Got no human grace
[02:02.18]You're eyes without a face
[02:06.47]♪
[02:17.48]When you hear the music, you make a dip
[02:20.32]Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
[02:23.57]You steal a car and go to Las Vegas
[02:27.00]Oh, gigolo pool
[02:28.95]I'm on this bus on a psychedelic trip
[02:31.54]Reading murder books, tryin' to stay hip
[02:35.05]I'm thinkin' of you, you're out there so
[02:38.57]Say your prayers
[02:41.28]Say your prayers
[02:43.94]Say your prayers
[02:47.94]♪
[02:57.17]Now I close my eyes
[03:01.17]And I wonder why
[03:04.68]I don't despise
[03:08.33]Now all I can do
[03:12.43]Love what was once
[03:15.39]So alive and new
[03:18.36]But it's gone from your eyes
[03:21.22]I'd better realize
[03:24.98](Les yeux sans visage)
[03:29.23]Eyes without a face
[03:30.87](Les yeux sans visage)
[03:34.90]Eyes without a face
[03:36.58](Les yeux sans visage)
[03:40.33]Eyes without a face
[03:43.36]Got no human grace
[03:46.07]You're eyes without a face
[03:48.62]Such a human waste
[03:51.79]You're eyes without a face
[03:57.23]And now it's getting worse
[03:59.72]♪
